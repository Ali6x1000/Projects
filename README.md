# Ali Nawaf's Projects Collection 🚀

## About Me 👨‍💻
Hi! I'm **Ali Nawaf**, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm passionate about solving complex problems and developing efficient algorithms. I have a strong background in Java, Python, algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. Apart from coding, I enjoy Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, hiking, and traveling.

This GitHub repository showcases a selection of my projects that reflect my diverse interests and technical skills. From mathematical function representations to data structures and algorithms, each project aims to provide efficient solutions to real-world problems.

## Projects 📂
Here’s a brief overview of the key projects in this repository:

### 1. **Mathematical Scientific calculator with derivitives ⚙️**
This project is a library designed to represent various mathematical functions such as `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `exp(x)`, `log(x)`, and polynomials. The library allows symbolic differentiation and composition of functions. It’s built using object-oriented principles to provide flexibility and extensibility in symbolic computation.

#### Key Features:
- Represent mathematical functions as classes (e.g., `Sin`, `Cos`, `Exp`).
- Calculate derivatives symbolically.
- Compose functions for complex expressions.
- Supports constants, variables, and polynomial operations.

### 2. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in Java 🌳**
This project demonstrates my implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java, where I manually implement the basic operations like insertion, deletion, and search without using built-in libraries. This project was part of an assignment to reinforce my understanding of tree structures and recursion.

#### Key Features:
- Custom implementation of tree operations.
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
- Designed for educational purposes to improve data structure knowledge.

### 3. **Python Projects 🐍**
This folder contains various Python projects related to algorithms, data structures, and optimization techniques. I enjoy working with Python for rapid prototyping and solving algorithmic challenges.

#### Key Features:
- Algorithms and logic problem-solving.
- Optimization solutions.
- Various smaller projects focusing on practical uses of Python in computing.
